    <h1>Hi, I'm Ian.</h1>
    <p class="aboutDev">
        I'm learning full-stack web development as a student in MSU's Coding Bootcamp. I'm conversant with HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and Google-Fu â€” the well-known coder language we all use when we're a little stuck. See my
        <a href="#projects">projects</a> below to see what I've brought to life so far.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutWriter">
        Before embarking on this programming journey, I researched and taught philosophy at Western Michigan University. Writing and thinking about
        philosophy is still a passion of mine, so be sure to check out my <a href="#writing">writing</a> if you're interested!
    </p>
    <p class="aboutContact">
        Whether you're an employer looking to hire or someone interested in discussing programming or philosphy, please
        feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me</a> using any of the methods at the bottom of the page.

                Here is a description of the projects below. However, I don't have any projects, so I guess it's not true that
                this is a discription of any projects. Huh. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Project 1 is pretty cool. It's does something, and it's deployed somewhere. The people who use this are
                possibly happy with it!

    <h2>Publications</h2>
    <p>
        As of today, I have only one publication in a book called <em>Greed in Our Everday World</em> (forthcoming). My chapter, 
        "Greed and Addiction," surveys the conceptual and practical similarities between greed and addiction, and I argue that the
        differences between common real-life cases turn out to be rather trivial. 
    </p>
    <h2>In progress</h2>
    <p>
        I'm currently working on a literature review that compiles some of the most recent philosophical and empirical research on 
        connections between social media, news consumption, and politics. Eventually, I'd like to turn this into an article arguing
        that we have an epistemic obligation to limit debating politics on and consuming news from social media.
